# Data Structures

This Project provides basic implementation for popular algorithms and data structures in some major programming languages, explanation and visual demonstration that strictly follow the implementation, aims at making complex things understandable to everyone, ease of learning from source code, test code, guides and visual demo.

Check website [Codetube.vn](https://codetube.vn) for details. All guide contents in this [github repo](https://github.com/dang1412/data-structures) will be reflected on the website.

The code may not ready for production (please help it does) but definitely useful to use. Current supported algorithms and data structures are:

- [Btree](https://codetube.vn/btree)
- [B+tree](https://codetube.vn/bplustree)
- [Suffixtree](https://codetube.vn/suffixtree)
- [RedBlackTree](https://codetube.vn/redblacktree)
- [Delaunator](https://codetube.vn/delaunay)

## Contribution

Implementations in all programming languages should follow the generic implementation guides, or it will need specific explanation for people to understand.

Contents are designed to be easy for everyone to contribute in various languages includes English, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese and so on. Please keep the language-version in right format to be displayed on [website](https://codetube.vn) properly, and be up to date with the English version as much as possible. All considerable contributors will be listed.

## References

The code and guides are referenced from many sources on the internet and will be all listed. Check specific algorithm place for detail.
