# About

Hi Engineers and Students I am working on this project https://codetube.vn/, you can find the brief idea on the home page. Currently it has only a few visual demos about some popular data structures but in long term we can visualize many things spreading on many areas from Algorithms, Geographic Math, Data Science, Physics… so it definitely take time to become truly useful for people to learn.

Now I am looking for partner who has the same interest about algorithms & data structures and passion on building interesting things that can help people learn. We can collaborate with each others to speed things up on ideas, source code, designs… grow together along the way and have better chance to output good things.

I’m building this using React and D3.js so experiences on that and strong knowledges about data structures will definitely help, but not mandatory because we all can learn as long as we want to.

Looking forward to hearing from you, and please don't forget to give a star to encourage me!
